# January 2014: Perspectives on File Structure

Organizing a project's file structure is the first step to maximizing efficiency while working. This is a subject that causes much debate among teams and people on the internet. Though there is no absolute answer for the best way to structure your Sass files, this presentation explores various approaches based on project depth and team size.

This presentation was given on January 8, 2014 by [Una Kravets](http://unakravets.com) at the [Canvas Coworking Space](canvas.co/work) and organized by the [Sassy DC](sassydc.github.io) meetup group.

The slides for this presentation were created using [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) and can be viewed at http://sassydc.github.io/20140106-file-structure.
